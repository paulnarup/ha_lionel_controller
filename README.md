- **Direction Control**: Switch between forward and reverse
- **Sound Effects**: Control horn, bell, and announcements  
- **Lighting**: Train lights control
- **Volume Controls**: Individual volume control for horn, bell, speech, and engine sounds
- **Connection Status**: Monitor Bluetooth connection status
- **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically discover locomotives when powered on
- **HACS Compatible**: Easy installation through HACS

## Supported Controls

### Number Entities
- **Throttle**: Variable speed control slider from 0-100%
- **Master Volume**: Overall volume control (0-10)
- **Horn Volume**: Horn sound volume (0-10)
- **Bell Volume**: Bell sound volume (0-10)
- **Speech Volume**: Announcement volume (0-10)
- **Engine Volume**: Engine sound volume (0-10)

### Switch Entities  
- **Lights**: Control locomotive lighting (defaults to on)
- **Horn**: Turn horn sound on/off
- **Bell**: Turn bell sound on/off

### Button Entities
- **Stop**: Emergency stop button (sets throttle to 0)
- **Forward**: Set locomotive direction to forward
- **Reverse**: Set locomotive direction to reverse
- **Disconnect**: Disconnect from locomotive
- **Announcements**: Various conductor announcements
  - Random
  - All Aboard
  - Full Steam Ahead
  - Winter Wonderland Express
- **Horn**: Brief horn press (button) in addition to the Horn switch (toggle)
- **Bell**: Brief bell ring (button) in addition to the Bell switch (toggle)

### Binary Sensor
- **Connection**: Shows Bluetooth connection status

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)
1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots menu and select "Custom repositories"
4. Add `https://github.com/iamjoshk/ha_lionel_controller` as an Integration
5. Install "Lionel Train Controller"
6. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation
1. Copy the `custom_components/lionel_controller` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Auto-Discovery (Recommended)
1. Power on your Lionel LionChief locomotive near your Home Assistant device
2. The integration will automatically detect the train and show a notification
3. Go to Settings → Devices & Services to see the discovered train
4. Click "Configure" to add it to Home Assistant

### Manual Setup
1. Go to Settings → Devices & Services
2. Click "Add Integration" 
3. Search for "Lionel Train Controller"
4. Enter your locomotive's Bluetooth MAC address
5. Optionally customize the name and service UUID
6. Click Submit

### Finding Your Train's MAC Address

You can find your locomotive's MAC address by:
1. Using a Bluetooth scanner app on your phone
2. Looking in Home Assistant Developer Tools → States for bluetooth devices
3. Using the ESPHome logs if you have the reference implementation
4. Using Home Assistant's built-in Bluetooth integration to scan for devices

### Example MAC Address Format
`FC:1F:C3:9F:A5:4A` (format: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX)

## Protocol Details

This integration implements the complete Lionel LionChief Bluetooth protocol based on multiple reverse-engineering efforts:

- **Primary Service UUID**: `e20a39f4-73f5-4bc4-a12f-17d1ad07a961` (LionChief control)
- **Device Info Service**: `0000180a-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` (standard BLE device information)
- **Write Characteristic**: `08590f7e-db05-467e-8757-72f6faeb13d4` (LionelCommand)
- **Notify Characteristic**: `08590f7e-db05-467e-8757-72f6faeb14d3` (LionelData)

### Enhanced Command Structure

The integration now uses the proper Lionel command format:
- **Byte 0**: Always `0x00` (command prefix)
- **Byte 1**: Command code (e.g., `0x45` for speed, `0x46` for direction)
- **Byte 2+**: Parameters specific to each command
- **Last Byte**: Checksum (simplified to `0x00` for compatibility)

### Device Information

The integration automatically reads and displays:
- Model number
- Serial number
- Firmware revision
- Hardware revision
- Software revision
- Manufacturer name

This information is displayed in Home Assistant's device registry for better identification.

## Compatibility

- Tested with Pennsylvania Flyer locomotive
- Should work with other LionChief Bluetooth locomotives
- Requires Home Assistant 2023.8.0 or later
- Requires Python bleak 0.20.0 or later

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Ensure locomotive is powered on and in Bluetooth pairing mode
- Check that locomotive is within Bluetooth range (typically 10-30 feet)
- Verify MAC address is correct
- Try restarting Home Assistant if connection issues persist

### Improved Connection Reliability
The integration uses `bleak-retry-connector` for enhanced connection stability:
- **Automatic Retries**: Failed connections are automatically retried up to 3 times
- **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing delays between retry attempts to avoid overwhelming the device
- **Service Caching**: Bluetooth service information is cached for faster subsequent connections
- **Better Error Handling**: More informative error messages for connection troubleshooting

### Service UUID Issues
Different locomotive models may use different service UUIDs. If the default doesn't work:
1. Use a Bluetooth scanner to find your locomotive's service UUID
2. Reconfigure the integration with the correct UUID
